#data/raw/luminex folder

This is where the raw Luminex files should go. This is set up this way so other raw data files (qPCR, CyTOF, etc.) can use the same project folder while maintaining separate data cleaning, etc.

For Example:
raw qPCR data can be placed in a data/raw/qPCR

These filepaths are flexible though requiring Rmd editing if desired for the luminex code.
